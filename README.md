Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model using Random Forest Regression to predict a target variable (e.g., housing prices). The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

Additionally, feature importance is calculated to identify which features most influence the predictions, and various visualizations are created to help understand the results.

Features of the Project:
Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

Training a Random Forest regression model

Model Evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R-squared

Visualizing Feature Importance using a bar plot

Model performance visualizations (Residual Plot, Predicted vs Actual)


Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn
